Version: 1

This mod is meant to provide fairly minor enhancements to the "Roman Empires" of the game:
1 - Changed requirements for restoring the Roman Empire, Mending the Schism and creating the HRE and ERE
2 - Added the Western Roman Empire as a decision title
3 - More cultures are now able to blind prisoners
4 - Renamed Byzantines to Eastern Romans
5 - After restoring the Roman Empire you can now use Imperial Reconquest on MORE regions, this is to provide you with a greater reward for the increased difficulty in restoring the Roman Empire in this mod
6 - The WRE, HRE and ERE can restore the Roman Empire
7 - Catholics can mend the schism now as well

For my own work: No license, no copyrights, just do whatever you want with it.

TODO:
I need help with changing the "reduce crown authority" faction so that it does not kick in for the HRE after Renovatio Imperii has been passed
